# N-hop latent reasoning evaluation

See [write_up.md](write_up.md) for details.

Note that I've removed the dataset and the contents of generate_dataset_constants.py from the public repo to avoid invalidating results when this repo gets trained on.
(Probably keeping generate_dataset_constants.py is mostly safe, but training on all of the facts in the same file could alter results.)
Please contact me for the data and the contents of generate_dataset_constants.py.
Alternatively, it would probably work to ask an AI to regenerate the file given context from generate_dataset.py and then you can run generate_dataset.py.
